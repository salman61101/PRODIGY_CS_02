PIXEL MANIPULATION FOR IMAGE ENCRYPTION
ðŸ“œ What I Did:
Installed the Required Libraries:
1. Python's Pillow for image processing.
2. NumPy for array manipulation.
Implemented Image Encryption:
1. Loaded the input image.
2. Converted the image to an RGB format.
3. Swapped the red and blue color channels of each pixel.
4. Saved the encrypted image.
Implemented Image Decryption:
1. Loaded the encrypted image.
2. Swapped the red and blue channels back.
3. Saved the decrypted image.
ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:
Understanding Image Processing: Learned how to manipulate image pixels using the Pillow library.
Basic Encryption Techniques: Gained insight into how simple encryption can be implemented using basic mathematical operations on pixel values.
Problem-Solving Skills: Enhanced my ability to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to file handling and image processing.
